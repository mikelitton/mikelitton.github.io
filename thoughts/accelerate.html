      marked('# Thoughts on “Accelerate”\n\n**Written:** 2020-01-31\n\nAny technology professional will benefit from reading this book. It’s practical in nature and offers both actionable advice as well as specific surveys you can run to assess your own culture, leadership and tech capabilities. It centered around the “DevOps” (BizDevOps / DevSecOps) movement which in turn is heavily inspired by lean practices and the thinking of though leaders such as Deming and Reinertsen.\n\nYou’ll be introduced to the four metrics of software delivery excellence: Lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to recovery (MTTR) as well as change fail rate. You probably recognise these from the “State of DevOps” reports that have been published during the last few years. The authors, using inferential predictive statistics, argue that there is a strong predictive link between high performing technology organisations and these metrics.\n\nTowards the end of the book there is a good reference to the “Overall Research Program” which contains a causal map of the various practices examined in the book. It starts with Transformational Leadership and ends with how this helps your organisational performance.\n\n[Download the reference here.](transformation_practices.pdf)\n\nHighly recommended.');
